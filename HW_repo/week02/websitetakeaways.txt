5 important Considerations for WireFraming
This article outlines five key takeaways that serve as essential guidelines when creating a wireframe. Understanding the problem or purpose that the website addresses is paramount to setting the right tone and connecting with the target audience effectively. Additionally, sketching the wireframe is a critical step, as it allows you to identify potential issues or mistakes early in the process, enabling you to address them proactively.
Seeking feedback on your wireframe is invaluable, fostering collaboration within your team and providing additional insights. Once you have completed your sketches, inputting them into a dedicated program for clear mapping, such as Omnigraffle as suggested in the article, is recommended. Finally, tailoring the depth and complexity of the wireframe to match the knowledge and experience levels of both your team and audience is crucial. For less experienced individuals, a more detailed wireframe may prove to be more useful in conveying the intended concepts effectively."
