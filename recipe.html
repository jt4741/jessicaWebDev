    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <li> 1 cup Cold Butter cut into small cubes </li>
        <li> 1 cup Brown Sugar </li> 
        <li> 1/2 cup Sugar </li>
        <li> 2 Eggs </li>
        <li> 1 1/2 cups Cake Flour* </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon Cornstarch </li>
        <li> 3/4 teaspoon Baking Soda </li>
        <li> 3/4 teaspoon Salt </li>
        <li> 2  cups Chocolate Chips </li>
        <li> 2 cups Walnuts roughly chopped </li>
    <h3> Directions </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat oven to 410 degrees. </li>
            <li> In a large mixing bowl, cream together cold cubed butter, brown sugar, and sugar for 4 minutes or until creamy. </li>
            <li> Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each one. </li>
            <li> Stir in flours, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt. Mix until just combined to avoid overmixing. Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts. </li>
            <li> Separate dough into large balls and place on lightly colored cookie sheet. They are bigger than you think! You will fit 4 cookies on one large cookie sheet. The dough makes 8 extra large cookies. </li>
            <li> Bake for 9-12 minutes or until golden brown on the top. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes to set. </li>
        </ol>
    <h2> Enjoy!!!!</h2>
    <h3> Notes </h3> 
        <li> You can substitute all-purpose flour for cake flour </li>
        <li>Levain Bakery has stated they don't use vanilla extract in their cookies. If you would like to add vanilla extract, I would suggest adding 1 teaspoon when adding the eggs to the batter.</li>
